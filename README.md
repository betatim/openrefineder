💠 + 📚 OpenRefine on Binder!

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/openrefineder/master)

Small demo of using OpenRefine on binder. Still under 👷🚧🏗!

# Using this

After the bidner launches open a new terminal (New -> Terminal), change to the
openrefine directory `cd openrefine-2.8` and launch `./refine`. Leave the
browser tab open.

Duplicate your tree view tab, and eeplace the `/tree` part of the URL with
`/proxy/333/`. Your URL should now look something like the following: https://hub.mybinder.org/user/XXXXXXX/proxy/3333/. Visit the URL in enjoy
using OpenRefine.

*Note:* the trailing slash on the URL is important. If you get a weird semi
loaded OpenRefine page check if you have the trailing slash.
